# Getting Started with Campus Link

To get your Campus Link application up and running, follow these steps:


```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/sanket-arch/campuslink-backend.git
2. cd campuslink
3. Refer to the .env-sample file included in the project for the required environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and set the variables accordingly.
4. Start spring boot application
```
## Usage

### Accessing the Application

Once the application is running, you can access it via `http://localhost:8080`.

### Authentication

Campus Link employs JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure its endpoints. Hereâ€™s how it works:

#### User Login

Users authenticate by sending their credentials (username and password) to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued.

#### Accessing Protected Endpoints

The JWT token must be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for accessing any protected endpoint.

**Example:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
```
### Token Validation

The server validates the token's authenticity and expiry before granting access to the requested resources.

### Example Workflow

***Login Request:***
```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "student1",
  "password": "password123"

```
***Login Response:***

{
    "Validity": "30 min",
    "Token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhaml0NjkiLCJpY.S-tgXU0Ci6QE"
}
```
***Accessing a Protected Endpoint:***
```http
GET /api/{resource}
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```
## API Endpoints
